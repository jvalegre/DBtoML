# INPUT FILE
input : 'Pd_squareplanar.smi' # input files
path : '' # path to guassian folder when we do analysis
prefix : False # if prefix : True, set a generic name for the different molecules (i.e. comp_1, comp_2, etc)

# TYPE OF DBGEN JOBS
verbose : True

# (1) CONFORMERS AND COM FILES GENERATION
# 3 options:
# Compute : True and write_gauss : True --> generates conformers in SDF files and writes COM files
# Compute : True and write_gauss : False --> generates conformers in SDF files only
# Compute : False and write_gauss : True --> reads SDF files from the main DBGEN folder (all SDF files)
compute : False
write_gauss : False # writting Gaussian COM files after, look options of write_gauss below

# (2) ANALYSIS OF LOG FILES
# if analysis is True, check all LOG files inside "generated_gaussian_files".
# The folder might multiple subfolders with levels of theory (i.e. coming from the conformer generation).
# This generates new COM files from LOG files with imaginary freqs or errors
analysis : True
sp : True # write COM files after analysis
dup : True # if dup : True, analysis will also separate duplicate LOG files

# COMMON PARAMETERS TO EDIT
gen_atoms : ['C'] # list of atoms included in the gen_ecp part
genecp_bs : ['LANL2DZ'] # functional for the genecp part

charge_sp : 3
mult_sp : 5
input_for_sp : 'NBO' # add the input line with keywords. For adjusting number of processors and memory, go belo (to gauss_write options)
qm_end_sp : '$NBO $END' # last line to add for single point
basis_set_sp : ['def2svp'] # basis set
level_of_theory_sp : ['wb97xd'] # functional
suffix : 'spc'
gen_bs_sp : ['LANL2DZ'] # functional for the genecp part
